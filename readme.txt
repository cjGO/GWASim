This R project was created for the final project of a Systems Biology course. Its purpose is to simulate the power of a sequencing
experiment by testing various sequencing depths and delta values for alleles of interest between 2 populations. The original 
scenario was to detect alleles between male and female populations that contribute to the sexual development of turtles, which are 
affected by temperature and genotypes.
